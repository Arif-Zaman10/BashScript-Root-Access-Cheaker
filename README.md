📌 Overview
This project contains a simple Bash script (check.sh) that checks if the current user has root privileges.
It demonstrates the use of environment variables and conditional statements in Bash.



⚙️ How It Works
- The script checks the value of the $UID variable:
    - UID = 0 → You are root.
    - UID ≠ 0 → You are a normal user.
- If the script is run as a non-root user, it will display a warning message.
- If run as root, it will allow access.



▶️ Usage
- Make the script executable (only needed once):
  ```bash
  chmod +x check.sh
- Run as a normal user:
  ```bash
  ./check.sh


📒 Notes
- $UID is a special environment variable in Linux that stores the user’s ID.
    - 0 = root
    - 1000+ = normal users
- Make sure to run the script with sudo if you want root access.
